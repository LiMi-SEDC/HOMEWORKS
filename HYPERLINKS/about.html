    <h2>WE PUT THE FUTURE AT YOUR FINGERTIPS</h2>
    <p>Can cars sense and respond to how the driver is feeling at a specific moment in time? Can warning systems perceive how dangerous a situation really is and make autonomous driving safe? Can dishwashers think for themselves and thereby achieve better results? Whether it’s in the field of (e-)mobility, the smart home or the Internet of Things, Marquardt connects man and machine with intelligent, electronic and electromechanical systems and components. That’s how we make life easier. For our customers. And for our customers’ customers. While the end user may not know there’s a piece of Marquardt integrated in their car or household appliance, they’ll certainly feel the progressive benefits. Because Marquardt puts the future at your fingertips.</p>
    <h2>TO ALL THOSE REACHING FOR THE STARS:</h2>
    <h2>WE’VE GOT THE LADDER.</h2>

Leading brands from the automotive, electronics and power tool industries rely on us as experts in interactive mechatronics. Because our passion for innovative technologies is what drives us.

We believe that success is all about putting a smile on users’ faces. Worldwide.</p>
