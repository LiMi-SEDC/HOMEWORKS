    <h1>National Basketball Association</h1>
    <hr>
    <small>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association" style="text-decoration: none;">NBA</a>)</small>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The<strong> National Basketball Association</strong> (<strong>NBA</strong>) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" style="text-decoration: none;">American</a> men's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports#Basketball" style="text-decoration: none;">professional basketball</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_league" style="text-decoration: none;">league</a>. It is composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada) and is one of the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada" style="text-decoration: none;">major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada</a>. It is the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.</p>
    <p>The league was founded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" style="text-decoration: none;">New York City</a> on June 6, 1946, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_Association_of_America" style="text-decoration: none;">Basketball Association of America</a> (BAA).It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_League_(United_States)" style="text-decoration: none;">National Basketball League</a>(NBL).The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. The league's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs" style="text-decoration: none;">playoff</a> tournament extends into June. As of 2020, NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.</p>
    <p>The NBA is an active member of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball" style="text-decoration: none;">USA Basketball</a> (USAB),which is recognized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA" style="text-decoration: none;">FIBA</a> (International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States. The league's several international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices in Midtown Manhattan, while its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Entertainment" style="text-decoration: none;">NBA Entertainment</a> and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey.</p>
    <p>The NBA is the third wealthiest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports">professional sport</a> league after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League" style="text-decoration: none;">National Football League</a> (NFL) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball" style="text-decoration: none;">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) by revenue.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>

    <h4>Creation and BAA–NBL merger (1946–1956)</h4>

    <p>When the BAA was founded there were two established professional leagues in the United States: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Basketball_League_(1925–1955)" style="text-decoration: none;">American Basketball League</a> in the East, founded 1925, and the National Basketball League in Midwestern industrial cities, founded 1937. However, most of the ABL and NBL teams played in small arenas, and in some cases even ballrooms or high school gymnasiums. Walter Brown, owner of the Boston Garden, believed that major ice hockey arenas, which sat empty on many nights, could be put to profitable use hosting basketball games when there were no ice hockey games to be played. To put this theory into practice, the BAA was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946. Maurice Podoloff, who was already serving as president of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League" style="text-decoration: none;">American Hockey League</a>, was appointed president of the BAA, becoming the first person to simultaneously lead two professional leagues (Joseph Carr had been president of the ABL from 1925 to 1928 while also overseeing the National Football League, although the NFL and ABL seasons did not overlap).</p>
    <h4>1946–47 season</h4>

    </dl>
    <p>The league started with 11 teams, which were divided into two divisions, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)" style="text-decoration: none;">Eastern Division</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)" style="text-decoration: none;">Western Division</a>. Each team played 60 or 61 regular season games. The best three teams from each division advanced to the playoffs. The two division winners received first-round byes and qualified directly to the semifinals, while the two second-place teams and two third-place teams competed in the best-of-3 quarterfinals, followed by the semifinals. The final series was also played in a best-of-7 format.
        On November 1, 1946, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_Leaf_Gardens" style="text-decoration: none;">Maple Leaf Gardens</a> in Toronto, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers, which the NBA now regards as the league's first official game. In the opening game of the BAA, Ossie Schectman scored the opening basket for the Knickerbockers.[15] The Eastern Division winner, the Washington Capitols, who had the best record with 49 wins, were defeated in the best-of-7 semifinal by the Western Division winner, the Chicago Stags. The Stags advanced to the finals along with the Philadelphia Warriors who defeated the New York Knickerbockers in the other semifinal. The Warriors won the inaugural BAA championship by winning the series 4–1.</p>

        <p>The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations, currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams; another is in Canada.

            The current league organization divides 30 teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004–05 season. Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: 13 teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the Pacific.</p>
